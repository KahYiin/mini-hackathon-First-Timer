1. Automatic Resume Parsing - 
* Extract Key Information: Automatically extract critical information from CVs, such as:
    * Name, contact information, address.
    * Work experience (job titles, companies, duration of employment).
    * Educational background (degrees, institutions, graduation dates).
    * Skills, certifications, and technical proficiencies.
* Multi-format Support: Support for parsing resumes in different formats like PDF, Word, or even images using OCR.

2. Skills Matching - 
* Keyword Extraction and Matching: Extract skills from resumes and match them with the required skills listed in job descriptions. Use synonyms and related terms (e.g., Python and programming languages) for more flexible matching.
* Advanced Skills Matching: Utilize word embeddings (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec) to match skills even if the terms used are different (e.g., “software development” could be matched with “programming”).

7. Resume Ranking and Scoring - 
* Scoring System: Assign a score to each resume based on how well it matches the job description. Factors that could influence the score include:
    * Skills match.
    * Relevant work experience.
    * Education and certifications.
    * Soft skills and other job-specific criteria.
* Weighted Ranking: Allow HR teams to assign different weights to various criteria (e.g., skills may weigh more than educational qualifications for certain jobs).

13. Job Fit Score Prediction - 
* Overall Fit Score: Use machine learning to predict an overall job fit score for each candidate based on their resume. The model can be trained using past hiring data to learn what attributes contribute most to successful hires for specific roles.
* Fit for Multiple Roles: If a candidate doesn’t match one role perfectly but may be suited for another role within the company, suggest alternative positions based on their skills and experience.

15. Seamless Integration with ATS (Applicant Tracking System) 
* Export Candidates: Allow easy integration with existing applicant tracking systems (ATS) so that recruiters can export shortlisted candidates and their scores directly into their workflow.
* API for External Platforms: Provide an API that recruitment platforms can integrate into their systems to enable resume screening on a large scale.
